The folder contains three files which are :
-caradisiac.js -main file-
-elastic.js -elasticSearch functions-
-documents.js (in app/routes) -routes-

My program is not working well. I tried to index some car models in elasticSearch with Postman
thanks to the endpoint populate but it just didn't work.
So I'm adding models directly in the "caradisiac.js" file by retrieving them with the node-car-api package
that you have provided.
